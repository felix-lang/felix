/* The idea of this filter is quite simple.  First, let's assume the
   search pattern is a simple string.  In order for a substring of a
   longer string to match the search pattern, it must have the same
   numbers of different characters as the pattern, and those
   characters must occur in the same order as they occur in pattern. */
