(* the function u expands an expression into an expression and some exes
which must be executed before the exe containing it, it has to
return these exes in REVERSE order because each case pushes the
base exe onto the top of the list.

The function u wraps special_inline.

At the end this function reverses the order so it returns the
expansion in FORWARD order.
