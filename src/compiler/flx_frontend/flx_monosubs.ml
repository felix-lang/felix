(* These functions take a term and perform type substitutions 
  using the provided substitution map. 

  If every type variable used in the term is in the map,
  and, every substitution in the map is monomorphic,
  the resultant term will be monomorphic.

  The substitution map is an association list of indices and types.

*)


(* This one is nasty, because it has to beta reduce after substitution,
and then, it has to actually replace virtual types we monomorphic
ones as well. Normally virtual to instance mapping would not occur
here, but it really is a substitution for a type variable,
its just the type variable is a virtual, a different kind
of type variable (in fact, existential).

FIXME: Its NOT clear to me why the result of that operation has to actually
be monomorphic. This is probably a bug.  However there's a check in there
that it is and I won't fix it until I have an example that triggers
the assertion.
