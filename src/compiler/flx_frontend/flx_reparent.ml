(* 
This module is responsible for reparenting children. When a function f is
inlined into g, f's children must become children of g, otherwise the
code body of f inlined into g will not work when it need to access a child.

To do this reparenting we clone the children of f and assign them the new
parent g. However this is not enough. We must also change the names
of all variables and labels (alpha conversion) so they don't clash
with those of g, which may also happen to include more than one
inlined copy of f. In particular, the child itself must be
renamed.. and of course references to it in the inlined body
of f have to be adjusted as well.

That too is not enough. When f is inlined, its parameters are
eliminated, either by substitution (lazy evaluation, pass-by-name),
or by creating variable and assigning the argument to it. Either
way, the child has to undergo the same process of eliminating
references to f's parameters.

But that too is not enough. If f is polymorphic, its type variables
will have been replaced, which means specialising every type variable
in the child as well.

The process is expensive and difficult, at least in part because
every expression and subexpression in Felix carries its type with it.
It is not enough to simply beta-reduce (substitute) because doing
so may leave a non-normal form: we must normalise too.

Finally, because some things are duplicated, for example in caches,
we must either ensure the caches are, or will eventually, be updated.

(* NOTE! when we specialise a routine, calls to the same
  routine (polymorphically recursive) need not end up
  recursive. They're only recursive if they call the
  original routine with the same type specialisations
  as the one we're making here.

  In particular a call is recursive if, and only if,
  it is fully polymorphic (that is, just resupplies
  all the original type variables). In that case,
  recursion is preserved by specialisation.

  However recursion can also be *introduced* by specialisation
  where it didn't exist before!

  So remapping function indices has to be conditional.

  Note that calls to children HAVE to be remapped
  because of reparenting -- the original kids
  are no longer reachable! But this is no problem
  because the kid's inherited type variables are
  specialised away: you can't supply a kid with
  type variable instances distinct from the kid's
  parents variables (or the kid would refer to the
  stack from of a distinct function!)

  So the only problem is on self calls of the main
  routine, since they can call self either with
  the current specialisation or any other.
