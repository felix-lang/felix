(* this calculates the use closure of i, eliminating recursive
  calls to the base function by restricting references
  to some set k. Note this means the usage of k is also
  not included.

  If k is set to the children of some function f,
  then this routine will not report usage of any
  variables in f via calls to f, only direct
  uses in some child which is called; in particular
  calls to outside the child tree of f are not tracked
  since they can't call any children of f,
  so they can only use them via a call to f.
  This would spawn a new stack frame, and so
  refer to different copies of variables.

  This routine is used to find which variables
  in f an expression in f can use via a call to a child.

  OUCH OUCH OUCH. I THINK THIS IDEA MUST BE BUGGED!

  Here's the problem. Given

  fun A(){
    fun B { fun C() {} return C; }
    fun D(f) { f 1; }
    D (B());
  }

  function B is returning a closure of C,
  which is being passed into D and called.
  Note D cannot see the function C.

  The inliner should handle this correctly:
  B is inlined to return a *clone* C' of C which
  is nested in A, then D is inlined, resulting
  in the call C' 1 (which can now be inlined too).

  The problem is that the assumption "calls outside
  the child tree of f are not tracked since they can't
  call any children of f" is wrong. A call outside
  the tree can still execute something inside
  the tree via a closure .. however how does the
  closure get out .. it has to be 'made' by someon
  who can see it ..


  ANOTHER BUG: it doesn't handle indirect use through
  virtual functions. If the function is itself inside
  a instance it can call into the virtual and map back
  into the same instance. If the function got cloned,
  the reference through the virtual will still be
  to the *original* uncloned function.
