    Throw a continuation. This is unsafe. It should
    work from a top level procedure, or any function
    called by such a procedure, but may fail
    if thrown from a procedure called by a function.
    The library run and driver will catch the
    continuation and execute it instead of the
    current continuation. If the library run is used
    and the continuation being executed is down the
    C stack, the C stack will not have been correctly
    popped. Crudely, nested drivers should rethrow
    the exception until the C stack is in the correct
    state to execute the continuation, but there is no
    way to determine that at the moment.

    Compiler generated runs ignore the exception,
    the library run catches it. Exceptions typically
    use a non-local goto, and they cannot pass across
    a function boundary.
