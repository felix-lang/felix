@h1 Simple function definitions

You can define simple calculations easily. 
We'll use a classic example:

@felix
fun square (x:int) => x * x;
@

The function @{square} just multiplies its argument @{x} by itself.
We can use it now:

@felix
write$ stdout, "Input number: "; fflush stdout;
val result = readln$ stdin;
val cleaned_result = strip result;
val v = int cleaned_result;
val v2 = square v;
println$ "Square of " + str v + " is " + str v2;
@input
42
@expect
Input number: 42
Square of 42 is 1764
@

Here:
<ul>
<li> The @{fun} binder introduces the function @{square}.</li>
<li> @{square} accepts a single argument of type @{int}.</li>
<li> The operator @{*} is used for multiplication.</li>
<li> @{square} returns the product of its argument with itself.</li>
<li> The type of value returned by @{square} is deduced by the compiler, 
that type will be @{int} because multiplying an @{int} by another @{int}
yields an @{int}. </li>
<li> The type @{int} can also be used as a function to convert a @{string} 
containing only digits to an @{int}.</li>
<li>The function @{str} can be used to convert an @{int} to a string.</li>
</ul>

There is a rule for functions: 

<blockquote><em>
A function introduced by a @{fun} binder is not allowed to have any side effects.
</em></blockquote>

The compiler does not enforce this rule, but it does take advantage of it when optimising your code. 

@h1 Anonymous function definitions (lambdas)


Functions can be named (as above), or they can be left nameless.
The former is beneficial when a function needs to be reused many times, and the latter for situations where reuse is not needed.
The distinction is blurred by the fact that nameless functions can be assigned to variables/values.
Still, there are many situations where anonymous functions are vital.

<em>
FYI: Referring to these as "lambda" functions is unavoidable.
Computer science literature (since Alonzo Church, circa 1930) is rife with the term.
If you get confused, just remember that it means "a nameless function without side-effects".
</em>

The syntax for defining an anonymous function is just like what we use for named functions, we just leave the name out.

@felix-unchecked
(fun (x:int) => x * x)
@

<em>Note: At present, Felix understands the code better when parentheses are included around the anonymous function.
It helps with scoping issues, but we apologize for having to include them.
A future version of Felix may not need them.</em>


@h1 Mapping

Functions are very useful for transforming one value to another.
If you need to do the same operation across several values, you should consider using map.
Furthermore, lambdas are ideal for one-off transformations.

The following uses of @{map} are equivalent.
The first uses a pre-defined function @{square'} (don't forget apostrophes can be part of the symbol name) and the second defines the square function in place.

@felix
var data = list(1,2,3);
fun square' (x:int) => x * x;

// the following are equivalent.
println$ unbox$ map square' data;
println$ unbox$ map (fun (x:int) => x * x) data;
@
@expect
list(1, 4, 9)
list(1, 4, 9)
@
