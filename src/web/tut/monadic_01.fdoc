@h1 Felix for monadic programming

"In plain terms, a monad is a set of rules that enforce regular
behavior but broad enough to allow most computational processes to be
expressed as a monad."
<em>--http://c2.com/cgi/wikiMonadicProgramming"</em>

@h2 The maybe monad

If <code>a</code> is a type variable and <code>M a</code> is a type,
then the characteristic property of <code>M</code> if it is a monad,
is that, there exists a function <code>bind</code> of type <code>M a
-> (a -> M b) -> M b</code> for <code>b</code> another type variable
(perhaps but not at all neccessarily the same as <code>a</code>). I
suggest that perhaps a helpful interpretation of <code>M a</code> is
that of <code>M</code> as a type function <code></code> applied to a
type <code>a</code>.

It seems that one of the easier monads to start with in the study of
monadic programming is the "maybe" monad built over something like the
Felix <code>opt[T]</code> types (see
http://felix-lang.org/lib/std/option.flx and
http://felix-lang.org/test/regress/monad-01.flx). Here's something
equivalent applied to the problem of "safe integer arithmetic". By
"safe" we simply mean trying to evaluate expressions while watching
out for division by zero and overflow.

To get going first define the sum <code>success[T]</code> to which
later will be imbued monadic properties.
@felix
variant success[T] = 
  | Success of T
  | Failure of string
  ;
@

Instances of <code>success[T]</code> are values. There are two
possibile patterns against which to match a given value :
<code>Success a</code> and <code>Failure[a] s</code> (in the
nomenclature of Haskell and Ocaml, <code>Success</code> and
<code>Failure</code> are "data constructors", <code>success[T]</code>
is a <em>type constructor</em>.). Consider for example the function
<code>str</code> for any <code>x:success[T]</code>:

@felix 
instance[T with Str[T]] Str[success[T]]
{
  //success[T] satisfies the requirements of the typeclass Str (if the
  //same can be said of T)

  fun str (x:success[T]):string =>
    match x with 
      | Success t => "Success " + (str t)
      | Failure s => "Failure " + s
    endmatch
    ;
}
@
Here is where things get interesting:
@felix
typefun Fallible (t:TYPE) : TYPE => success[t] ;
@
This is a type function. <code>Fallible</code> is a function in one
type argument with domain and codomain both <code>TYPE</code>. The
type this computation results in specifically is
<code>success[t]</code>.

The following syntax declares the intent to make a monad out of
<code>Fallible</code>:
@felix
instance Monad[Fallible]
{
@
Now, the crucial definition for <code>bind</code><em> (pay particular
attention to <code>bind</code>'s type and compare it with the type
spelled out in the introduction!)</em>
@felix
  fun bind[a, b] (x:Fallible a, f: a -> Fallible b):Fallible b =>
    match x with
      | Success a => f a
      | Failure s => Failure[b] s
    endmatch
    ;
@
One last ingredient is needed to make this (almost) monad useful.  We
need a function to "lift" values of type <code>a</code> into the monad
<code>Fallible a</code>. The usual name for this function is
<code>return</code> and is obliged to have type <code>a -> M
a</code>. In Felix, the convention is to denote this function
<code>ret[T]</code>:
@felix
  fun ret[a](x:a):Fallible a => Success x ;

}//instance Monad[Fallible]
@
That's it for defining the monad. The functions implementing safe
arithmetic read as follows.
@felix
//Safe arithmetic. 

const INT_MAX:int requires Cxx_headers::cstdlib ;
const INT_MIN:int requires Cxx_headers::cstdlib ;

fun madd (x:int) (y:int) : success[int] => 
  if (x > 0 and y > (INT_MAX - x)) or 
     (x < 0 and y < (INT_MIN - x))
  then
      Failure[int] "overflow"
  else
    Success (y + x)
  endif
  ;

fun msub (x:int) (y:int) : success[int] => 
  if (x > 0 and y < (INT_MIN + x)) or
     (x < 0 and y > (INT_MAX + x))
  then
    Failure[int] "overflow"
  else
    Success (y - x)
  endif
  ;

fun mmul (x:int) (y:int) : success[int] => 
  if y > 0 and x > 0 and y > (INT_MAX / y) or
     y > 0 and x <= 0 and x < (INT_MIN / y) or
     y <= 0 and x > 0 and y < (INT_MIN / x) or
     y <= 0 and y != 0 and x <= 0 and x < (INT_MAX / y) then
        Failure[int] "overflow"
  else
    Success (y * x) 
  endif
  ;

fun mdiv (x:int) (y:int) : success[int] => 
    if (x == 0) then 
        Failure[int] "attempted division by zero" 
    else 
      if y == INT_MIN and x == -1 then
        Failure[int] "overflow"
      else
        Success (y / x) 
    endif 
    ;
@
Hopefully the syntax of the functions
@felix--unchecked
fun madd (x:int) (y:int) : success[int] => 
  //...
  ;
@
didn't confuse you? <code>madd</code> above is a function in its
"curried" form. A function like <code>fun f (x:a)(y:b)</code> is a
shorthand for <code>fun f (x:a) => fun (y:b)</code>. Looked at this
way it's clear that there really isn't any such thing as a
multi-argument function in mathematics or Felix. Functions take (at
<em>most</em>) one argument!  If you find that confusing don't worry -
most everyone needs a while to get that idea.

Enabling the monadic interpertation of <code>success[T]</code> is
achieved with the directive
@felix
open Monad[Fallible] ;
@
... and now we're ready to to build and evaluate arithmetic
expressions.
@felix
//Evalue some simple expressions.

val zero = ret 0 ;
val zero_over_one = bind ((Success 0), (mdiv 1)) ;
val undefined = bind ((Success 1),(mdiv 0)) ;
val two = bind((ret 1), (madd 1)) ;
val two_by_one_plus_one = bind (two , (mmul 2)) ;

println$ "zero = " + str zero ;
println$ "1 / 0 = " + str undefined ;
println$ "0 / 1 = " + str zero_over_one ;
println$ "1 + 1 = " + str two ;
println$ "2 * (1 + 1) = " + str (bind (bind((ret 1), (madd 1)) , (mmul 2))) ;
println$ "INT_MAX - 1 = " + str (bind ((ret INT_MAX), (msub 1))) ;
println$ "INT_MAX + 1 = " + str (bind ((ret INT_MAX), (madd 1))) ;
println$ "INT_MIN - 1 = " + str (bind ((ret INT_MIN), (msub 1))) ;
println$ "INT_MIN + 1 = " + str (bind ((ret INT_MIN), (madd 1))) ;

println$ "--" ;
@
It's suprising what looking at things a different way can bring.
@felix
syntax monad //Override the right shift assignment operator.
{
  x[ssetunion_pri] := x[ssetunion_pri] ">>=" x[>ssetunion_pri] =># "`(ast_apply ,_sr (bind (ast_tuple ,_sr (,_1 ,_3))))";
}
open syntax monad;
@
Here the traditional rshift-assign operator is substituted for
<code>bind</code> (I won't pretend to tell you that I understand the
details of how!). Now safe arithmetic expressions are so naturally
represented as computation chains!
@felix
println$ "zero = " + str (ret 0) ;
println$ "1 / 0 = " + str (ret 1 >>= mdiv 0) ;
println$ "0 / 1 = " + str (ret 0 >>= mdiv 1) ;
println$ "1 + 1 = " + str (ret 1 >>= madd 1) ;
println$ "2 * (1 + 1) = " + str (ret 1 >>= madd 1 >>= mmul 2) ;
println$ "INT_MAX = " + str (INT_MAX) ;
println$ "INT_MAX - 1 = " + str (ret INT_MAX >>= msub 1) ;
println$ "INT_MAX + 1 = " + str (ret INT_MAX >>= madd 1) ;
println$ "INT_MIN = " + str (INT_MIN) ;
println$ "INT_MIN - 1 = " + str (ret INT_MIN >>= msub 1) ;
println$ "INT_MIN + 1 = " + str (ret INT_MIN >>= madd 1) ;
println$ "2 * (INT_MAX/2) + 1 = " + str (ret INT_MAX >>= mdiv 2 >>= mmul 2 >>= madd 1) ; //The last one since we know INT_MAX is odd and that division will truncate.
println$ "2 * (INT_MAX/2 + 1) = " + str (ret INT_MAX >>= mdiv 2 >>= madd 1 >>= mmul 2) ;
