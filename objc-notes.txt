Objective C notes. I keep getting lost so I'm going to put stuff here.

The main header for the objc run time. There seem to be two copies of it.


48 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  80614 27 Sep  2019 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include/objc/runtime.h
40 -rw-r--r--  7 root  wheel  80614  4 Sep  2019 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/objc/runtime.h

The objc run time.

0 lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  15 16 Oct  2019 /usr/lib/libobjc.dylib -> libobjc.A.dylib

Both these things seem not inside any frameworks.

FYI:

~/felix>ls /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib
ACIPCBTLib.tbd			libcups.tbd			libnetsnmpmibs.tbd
AppleConvergedTransport.tbd	libcupsimage.2.tbd		libnetsnmptrapd.25.tbd
.....

It's just a  bunch of tbd files.
